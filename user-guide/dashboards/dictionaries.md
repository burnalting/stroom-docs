Now just add any search terms you want to the newly created dictionary and click save.

You can add multiple terms.

* Terms on separate lines act as if they are part of an 'OR' expression when used in a search.
* Terms on a single line separated by spaces act as if they are part of an 'AND' expression when used in a search.

## Using
To perform a search using your dictionary, just choose the newly created dictionary as part of your search expression:
